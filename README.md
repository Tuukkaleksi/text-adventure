## Text Adventure With OpenAIAPI

### Website
    - Coming when its playable

### Login and Signup
    - To save your progress
    - idk actually lol

### What To Do?
    - Frontend ( Mostly done )
    - Chatroom ( Need mostly frontend and few fixes )
    - Actual Gameplay ( Can interact with the AI now )
    - Checker for Api Key just to make sure its not something user just inputs ( the AI doesnt even work with invalid key )

### Updates
    - Frontend: Sign In/Out, Adventure Setting
    - Users can now add their Adventure Setting and OpenAI Api Key
    - OpenAI Api Key gets removed from the database after logout
    - A Menu has been added, Sign Out works only
    - OpenAI has been started and works fine but what AI says is bit wierd, need fixing etc
    - Error messages on Sign Up and Sign In

### OpenAI Api Key
    - No. The Api Key gets removed on Sign Out.
    - You need to add a new one when entering the site again.
    - Made this so it cant be vulnerable.

#### Made With Vite Typescript React App
    - Made this project for my Portfolio
    - Hopefully employers see this as PLUS
